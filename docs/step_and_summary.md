### Step: Start Planning Advanced Sync Features (Granular Step 8)
**Summary:**
- Initiated planning phase for advanced sync features after successful completion of frontend and backend UAT.
- The goal is to enhance the sync logic with features such as conflict resolution, failover, master election, offline queueing, and audit trails.
- This step will involve reviewing the current sync implementation, identifying gaps, designing new features, and breaking them down into actionable tasks.

**Advanced Sync Features Planning Checklist:**
- [ ] Review current sync logic for gaps and limitations
- [ ] Design and document advanced features (conflict resolution, failover, master election, offline queueing, audit trails)
- [ ] Break down each feature into granular implementation tasks
- [ ] Update architecture and implementation plan docs
- [ ] Get stakeholder approval before implementation

**Plan:**
1. Analyze the current sync protocol and identify areas for improvement.
2. Research and design advanced sync mechanisms (e.g., last-writer-wins, multi-device conflict handling, automatic failover).
3. Document proposed features and update system diagrams as needed.
4. Break down each feature into specific, actionable development tasks.
5. Review and update architecture and implementation plan documentation.
6. Present the plan to stakeholders for feedback and approval.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Consider edge cases such as network partitions, device clock drift, and simultaneous edits.
- Evaluate performance and scalability of proposed features.
- Plan for automated testing and monitoring of advanced sync logic.

### Step: Design Advanced Sync Features - Master-Client Failover Protocol
**Summary:**
- Analyzed current sync logic and identified gaps in master-client failover scenarios.
- Designed a robust protocol for handling device shutdown/restart scenarios to prevent data loss.
- Decided on Option B approach: When a former Master device restarts, it becomes a Client to the current Master until the current Master shuts down.

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Master Election**: When Master device shuts down, a designated Client becomes new Master automatically.
- **Device Restart Protocol**: When former Master restarts, it becomes Client to current Master and syncs all changes.
- **Data Consistency**: No data loss - all changes made while device was offline are preserved and synced.
- **Role Transfer**: Former Master remains Client until current Master shuts down (no immediate role reclamation).

**Advanced Sync Protocol Design:**
1. **Device A (Master) Shutdown:**
   - Device A broadcasts "shutdown" event to all Clients
   - Designated Client (Device B) becomes new Master
   - Device B continues operations with full functionality

2. **Device B (New Master) Operations:**
   - All changes logged locally and queued for sync
   - Maintains authoritative database state
   - Handles all Client connections and sync requests

3. **Device A Restart:**
   - Device A starts up and broadcasts "online" event
   - Device B (current Master) responds with "I'm Master" + current state
   - Device A syncs with Device B to get all changes made while offline
   - Device A becomes Client to Device B
   - Device A's local DB updated with all changes from Device B

4. **Data Reconciliation:**
   - Device A receives complete sync of all changes made by Device B
   - No data loss - all operations preserved
   - Conflict resolution handled by current Master (Device B)

**Next Steps:**
- Break down this protocol into specific implementation tasks
- Design the WebSocket events and REST endpoints needed
- Plan the database schema changes for tracking device roles and sync state
- Create detailed implementation plan for each component

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Add device priority system for Master election
- Implement graceful Master role transfer with user notification
- Add monitoring and logging for all failover events
- Consider adding manual override for Master role assignment

--- 

### Step: Design WebSocket Events and Database Schema for Advanced Sync
**Summary:**
- Designed comprehensive WebSocket events for master-client failover protocol
- Planned database schema changes for tracking device roles and sync state
- Created detailed implementation tasks for each component
- Prepared architecture documentation updates

**WebSocket Events Design:**

**Device Management Events:**
- `device_online` - Device announces it's back online
- `device_offline` - Device announces it's going offline
- `device_shutdown` - Master device announces shutdown
- `master_election` - New master election process
- `role_change` - Device role changed (master/client)

**Sync Events:**
- `sync_request` - Client requests sync with master
- `sync_response` - Master responds with sync data
- `sync_complete` - Sync operation completed
- `sync_conflict` - Conflict detected during sync
- `sync_error` - Error during sync operation

**Data Events:**
- `data_update` - Data changed, broadcast to all clients
- `data_request` - Request specific data from master
- `data_response` - Response with requested data
- `queue_status` - Status of offline sync queue

**Database Schema Changes:**

- Added python-socketio==5.9.0 and python-engineio==4.7.1
- All dependencies now properly versioned and available

**2. Advanced Sync REST Endpoints Implemented:**
- **Device Role Management:**
  - GET /device/roles - Get all device roles
  - GET /device/roles/<device_id> - Get specific device role
  - PUT /device/roles/<device_id> - Update device role
- **Sync State Management:**
  - GET /sync/state/<device_id> - Get sync state for device
  - PUT /sync/state/<device_id> - Update sync state for device
- **Master Election Logs:**
  - GET /sync/master-election-logs - Get master election history
- **Audit Logs:**
  - GET /sync/audit-logs - Get sync audit logs with filtering

**3. Duplicate Event Handlers Resolved:**
- Removed unused advanced_socketio_events.py file
- Confirmed socketio_events.py is the primary event handler file
- Eliminated potential conflicts and confusion
