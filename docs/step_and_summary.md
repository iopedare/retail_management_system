---

### Step: Backend Automated Test Coverage
**Summary:**

  - WebSocket: critical_event, acknowledge, register_device
  - Edge cases, error handling, and audit log verification
- All tests passing with pytest

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Expand frontend test coverage after integration
- Add more advanced sync features or security/authentication as needed

### Step: Draft frontend sync architecture doc (ARCHITECTURE.md)
**Summary:**
- Created and updated frontend/ARCHITECTURE.md to document the planned sync logic, master-client roles, periodic and immediate sync, and integration points with backend APIs and WebSocket events.
- Added a Mermaid diagram and step-by-step protocol for frontend-backend sync.
- Ensured the architecture doc aligns with backend sync logic and project requirements.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Update the architecture doc as new frontend sync features are implemented.
- Add more UI/UX flow diagrams as the frontend evolves.

---

### Step: Scaffold Flutter API/WebSocket integration
**Summary:**
- Implemented sync_api_service.dart for REST API calls to backend sync endpoints.
- Implemented sync_socket_service.dart for WebSocket (Socket.IO) integration with backend real-time sync events.
- Verified that both services are integrated into main.dart and ready for device registration and event handling.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Add error handling and reconnection logic to the socket service.
- Expand API service to support additional endpoints as needed.

---

### Step: Implement device registration and sync event handling (Frontend)
**Summary:**
- Implemented device ID generation and persistence using SharedPreferences in Flutter.
- Added REST API call for device registration before WebSocket connection.
- Improved WebSocket logic: device registration after (re)connect, reconnection logic, and error handling.
- Enhanced UI feedback for registration and sync status.
- Added comments for all complex logic.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Further improve error/retry UI for failed registration or sync.
- Add more granular integration tests for edge cases.
- Review backend registration endpoint for robustness and security.

---

### Step: Test UI updates for all sync status transitions (Frontend)

- Created test mode functionality to simulate backend failures and disconnections.
- Fixed multiple issues: setState after dispose, nullable socket handling, case-sensitive status matching.
- All three integration tests now pass: successful registration, registration failure with retry button, and WebSocket disconnection.
- Tests use proper Flutter integration testing framework with 8-second pumpAndSettle for reliable UI updates.

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- Add more edge case tests (network timeouts, malformed responses).
- Consider adding performance tests for sync operations.
- Add tests for concurrent device registrations.
- Consider adding visual regression tests for UI components.

   - Simulate network disconnections and verify reconnection behavior
   - Collect user feedback on sync performance and reliability
   - Log any issues, bugs, or feature requests

3. **UAT Documentation:**
