## ðŸ§¾ Order Request to Sale Workflow

1. **Order Request Creation**
   - Admin or Manager creates an order request:
     - Selects customer or walk-in
     - Adds items with quantity
     - Assigns to staff (Assistant Manager or Sales Assistant)
     - Optionally sets discount or notes
2. **Request Processing**
   - Assigned staff sees pending request
   - Can approve, modify (quantity/discount), or reject
   - Once approved, processed as a Sale:
     - Generates receipt
     - Updates product quantities
3. **Audit Trail**
   - All processed requests are linked to the originating Admin/Manager for audit

## ðŸ”„ Offline-First & Sync Logic
- Each device maintains its own SQLite DB.
- Every write operation is time-stamped and queued for sync.
- On LAN availability:
  - Devices push unsynced records to the Master Node
  - Master aggregates updates and broadcasts critical deltas (e.g., updated stock levels)
- Sync conflict resolution based on latest timestamp or Master priority.

## ðŸ’³ Accounting Flow
- Expenses tracked by any role with access (Admin, Manager, Assistant Manager)
- Revenue automatically logged per sale
- Daily financial summary auto-calculated:
  - Opening stock value
  - Sales revenue
  - Expenses
  - Closing balance
