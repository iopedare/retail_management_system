# üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Plan ‚Äì Retail Management System

This document provides a detailed, step-by-step plan for implementing the Retail Management System as described in the PRD. Each section is broken into granular, actionable tasks. Update this plan as requirements evolve.

---

## 1. Project Setup & Architecture
- Initialize Git repository and project structure
- Set up core markdown documentation (see workflow.md)
- Set up backend (Flask + Flask-SocketIO) and frontend (Flutter Desktop) environments
- Define master-client architecture and offline-first sync logic
- Set up local SQLite database schema (see PRD for tables)

## 2. User Roles & Authentication
- Implement user roles and permissions (Admin, Manager, Assistant Manager, Inventory Assistant, Sales Assistant)
- Create authentication endpoints (login, logout, session management)
- Enforce single-device login (except Admin override)
- Device ID logic and failover handling
- Session timeout and audit logging

## 3. Core Backend API
- Scaffold REST and WebSocket APIs for:
  - User management
  - Product & inventory (with batch/expiry tracking)
  - Supplier management
  - Order & POS operations
  - Customer & loyalty management
  - Reporting & analytics
  - Device/system management
- Implement database models for all core tables (see PRD schema)
- Add timestamp and audit fields to all tables

## 4. Frontend Foundation
- Set up Flutter navigation, role-based access, and UI scaffolding
- Implement login screen and role-based redirects
- Create main dashboard layout (sidebar, top bar, alert panel)
- Add system health and sync status indicators
- Sync status UI implemented, tested, and documented (see PROJECT_CHECKLIST.md and step_and_summary.md)

## 5. Point of Sale (POS) Module
- Product search (name, barcode, SKU)
- Barcode scanning integration
- Cart management (add/remove, quantity, real-time calculations)
- Discount engine (percentage/fixed, approval logic)
- Customer loyalty integration (lookup, points, tiers)
- Payment processing (cash, ATM, split, loyalty points)
- Order hold/resume/cancel/auto-expire
- Invoice generation (detailed breakdown)
- Stock validation (prevent sale if out/expired)

## 6. Inventory Management
- Stock operations (add, update, batch tracking)
- Batch number and expiry date management
- FIFO/FEFO logic for stock rotation
- Pricing logic (cost, markup, dynamic pricing)
- Stock tracking (by product, batch, expiry)
- Alerts (low stock, expiry, batch recall)
- Bulk operations (batch entry, expiry updates, transfers)

## 7. Supplier Management
- Supplier CRUD (with validation, inline creation)
- Invoice tracking (unique per supplier, validation)
- Supplier analytics (lead time, quality, compliance)

## 8. Order Management
- Order creation (Admin/Manager, loyalty lookup)
- Real-time push to cashier via WebSocket
- Order status tracking (pending, completed, expired, cancelled)
- Auto-expiry and order note handling

## 9. Customer & Loyalty Management
- Customer registration and database
- Loyalty program configuration (points, tiers, redemption)
- Loyalty analytics and promotional tools
- Birthday/anniversary promotions

## 10. Reporting & Analytics
- Profit/loss, sales, inventory, customer, and supplier reports
- KPI widgets and graphical dashboards
- Export options (PDF, Excel, CSV)
- Scheduled and custom report builder

## 11. Real-time Sync & Offline Logic
- WebSocket setup for live updates and device discovery
- Offline queueing and sync logic (last-writer-wins, conflict resolution)
- Master election and failover protocol
- Sync logs and audit trails
- ‚úÖ UAT testing completed for backend sync features - device registration, disconnect/reconnect, error handling all validated
- ‚úÖ Advanced sync features planning completed - master-client failover protocol, WebSocket events, database schema designed
- ‚úÖ WebSocket events and advanced sync models integrated and tested (DeviceRole, SyncState, MasterElectionLog, SyncAuditLog)
- **Next**: Continue backend/frontend integration and add more comprehensive tests
- **Next**: Update documentation and API references for new sync features

## 12. Device Management & Hardware Integration
- Device ID assignment and switching
- Primary/backup device logic
- Barcode scanner and receipt printer setup
- Router/network status monitoring

## 13. Security & Compliance
- Password policies and multi-factor authentication
- Role-based access enforcement
- Data encryption and integrity checks
- PCI DSS and GDPR compliance
- Audit trail for all financial transactions

## 14. Packaging, Deployment & Documentation
- Backend bundling (PyInstaller)
- Frontend build (Flutter Windows executable)
- Installer creation (Inno Setup)
- Database migration scripts
- Sample data and demo mode
- User manual and training materials
