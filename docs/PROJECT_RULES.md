## 1. Always Stick with the Plan
- All team members and contributors must follow the agreed implementation plan and PRD.
- Any proposed changes or deviations must be discussed and approved before implementation.

## 2. Project Checklist
- Maintain a clear, up-to-date project checklist (e.g., PROJECT_CHECKLIST.md) at all times.
- Immediately update the checklist after completing, starting, or modifying any task or milestone.
- Use the checklist to track progress, blockers, and next steps.

## 3. Planning and Approval Before Coding
- Before writing any code, always provide a detailed plan for the proposed implementation.
- Wait for explicit user/stakeholder agreement before proceeding with any implementation.
- Once a plan is agreed upon, add it to the project checklist immediately.
- As you complete each step, check it off in the checklist before moving to the next step.
